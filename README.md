## Overview

This is an R package that contains functions suitable to my own habits to facilitate the execution of everyday tasks. If you have visited this page, you are probably my student or colleague, so I don't think any further explanation would be justified.

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marcellgranat/granatlib")
```

## Usage

The functions in this package are ad-hoc developed, so you will everything in the [reference menu](https://marcellgranat.com/granatlib/reference)
